      <p>
        At test, your satisfaction is our priority. If you’re not completely happy with your purchase, we’re here to help.
      </p>
        <h3>Returns</h3>
        <p>
        We accept returns within 14 days of the delivery date. To be eligible for a return, your item must be:
        
        Unused and in the same condition that you received it
        
        In its original packaging
        
        Accompanied by a receipt or proof of purchase
      </p>
        
        Certain types of items are non-returnable, including:
          
        Downloadable software or digital products
        
        Personal care items (e.g., skincare, cosmetics)
        
        Customized or personalized products
        
        Refunds
        Once we receive and inspect your return, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment within 5–10 business days.
        
        Please note: Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping may be deducted from your refund unless the return is due to our error (e.g., defective or incorrect item).
        
        Exchanges
        We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to exchange it for the same item, contact us at [your support email].
        
        How to Start a Return
        To initiate a return, please contact us at test@gmail with your order number and reason for return. We’ll provide instructions and a return shipping address.
        
        Late or Missing Refunds
        If you haven’t received a refund yet:
        
        Check your bank account again
        
        Contact your credit card company – it may take some time before your refund is officially posted
